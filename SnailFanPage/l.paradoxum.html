        <h3>The mind-controlling parasite of Zombie Snails!</h3>

        <p> 
            Leucochloridium paradoxum is a species of flatworm that infects gastropods (snails & slugs) in order to infect their definitive hosts, birds. 
            They are distributed across North America and Europe, but luckily do not infect humans! 
            When its eggs are consumed by the snail accidentally, the sporocysts hatch and migrate, predominantly, to the left tentacle of the snail. 
            It takes over the snail's behavior, causing it to abnormally expose itself to predators, and then it starts to pulsate in the tentacle. 
            Predators, such as birds, are attracted and consume the hapless snails. Once consumed by the bird, L. paradoxum, once in its adult form, 
            will attach itself to the bird's digestive tract and consume passing plant matter until it's ready to release its eggs near the bird's rectum.
             The eggs will then go on to infect more snails, thus continuing the morbid cycle.
